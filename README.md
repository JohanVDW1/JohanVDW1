Hi there,  
I'm an aspiring data analyst who has recently undertaken a boot camp to achieve this goal  
in which I was taught data analysis software, including Power BI and tableau, as well as  
code programs such as Python, R and SQL.  
Achieved the PL-300 data analyst certificate.  
I have attained a degree in Buisness Managment and Economics achieving a 2:1 grade.
